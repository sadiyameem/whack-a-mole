# whack-a-mole

# Description
A fun browser based game where you click a mole as it pops up in random squares and try to score as many points as you can before time runs out. I built this with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I made this with the help of a video. The things I added myself where CSS colors and game button and a image of my choice.

# Features
- Score counter
- Start game button
- 3x3 grid where the mole appears
- Pop-up alert with final score.

# How to Play
Click Start Game
Click the mole quickly to earn points
The game ends after 30 seconds

# Motivation
I created this game to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while building something fun.

# Challenges & Learning
Some challenges I had were finding the right image and colors.
Somthing I learned was to make the grid and image appear.
